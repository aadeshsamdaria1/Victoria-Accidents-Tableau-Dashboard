Excellent work on this exquisite dashboard! I really love the color scheme of your dashboard, and using icons to represent vehicle types is a fantastic idea. The combination of the line chart and area chart on the left is very fitting. The addition of appropriate filters enhances interactivity, allowing for a comparison of data across different years on the dashboard. However, a small suggestion: using a heat map to display accident counts in different areas might align more with the overall design. Overall, it represents a significant amount ofÂ effort!
